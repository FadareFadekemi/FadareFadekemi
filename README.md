 -Hi, I'm passionate about Data Science and AI Engineering, and I'm currently building my expertise in these fields. With a strong foundation in data analysis and machine learning
🎯 Current Focus
* Data Science: I am working on mastering data wrangling, data visualization, and statistical analysis. Currently learning how to effectively process, clean, and analyze large datasets using Python and popular libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

 *AI Engineering: I am focusing on machine learning and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. My goal is to specialize in developing AI models that can solve real-world problems.

 Tools & Technologies:

Python, SQL
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch(in progress)
Jupyter Notebooks, Git & GitHub
Docker, Kubernetes (in progress)

📚 Learning Goals
 Building expertise in supervised and unsupervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.
 Understanding neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and GANs, and applying them to real-world projects.
  Cloud technologies : Hadoop, Azure

📝 Projects & Experience

 Analyzing large datasets to uncover insights, create visual reports, and make data-driven decisions.

Learning how to deploy models into production using frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, and cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure.

Certifications : Associate data scientist in python (Data camp) in progress
