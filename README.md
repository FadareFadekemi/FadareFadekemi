I architect systems centered on Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Agentic workflows. My technical focus involves building RAG pipelines that leverage external tools to execute complex tasks. I specialize in fine-tuning large language models for domain-specific accuracy to ensure high-precision performance across diverse datasets.
I manage the full lifecycle of AI applications from local development in Python to cloud-native deployment. I utilize Google Cloud and Render to host scalable inference endpoints and manage persistent data layers through optimized SQL querying.
